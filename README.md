Hi! I am 25 years old and live in Switzerland. I started programming in 2015 while doing my CFC in computer science in Lausanne at the [ETML](https://www.etml.ch/). I recently graduated from the [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science / Software Engineering. Currently working for [inetis](https://www.inetis.ch) as a Junior Devlopper.
